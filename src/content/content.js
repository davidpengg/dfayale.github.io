The team underwent a full redesign of CTSBDC's Marketplace website, which is home to promotional material for small businesses in the area. This work included the addition of a blog feature to the new site, and expansion of accessibility for businesses to benefit from the program. The team also compiled a small business guide containing content on physical as well as online presence, to be distributed to small businesses on behalf of the CTSBDC.",

      'We collaborated with Unilever, a multinational consumer goods company, to address how Unilever can increase consumer use of refill formats for personal care products.',
    description:
      'We first conducted multiple interviews and a large-scale survey with 240 participants regarding their opinion of and experience with sustainable personal care products. Key insights from this survey included discovering the following: (1) that customers care most about affordable price (85.8%), product purpose and effectiveness (71.1%), and familiar brand (59.9%) when purchasing personal care products, (2) that customers are most likely to refrain from using a refillable product if they cannot find it at the places they shop (65.9%), they feel that it takes too much work or time (40.5%), or they have already settled on a favorite product that does not have a refill option (31%). After ideating, reframing, immersing, prototyping, and testing our ideas, we were able to create our final product: a Caddy and Sustainable Shower Set (CASSS), which was created in order to reduce plastic use and be customizable and accessible. We also outlined the user journey for Yale undergraduate students, who were our primary focus during the design challenge. Finally, we presented our findings at the Unilever Spring 2021 National Project Expo.',

We also collaborated with Nucleus, a group linked with URI that created the New Haven Botanical Garden of Healing Dedicated to Victims of Gun Violence, to inform more people about and draw them to the garden.',
    description:
      'For URI, we created a newly designed catalogue for each tree that URI plants, complete with a table of contents organized by whether the tree can be planted in a space with or without utility wires; pictures of the full tree in summer, fall, and winter; and descriptions of each tree with max height and spread. Furthermore, we created specific icons for full sun vs. part shade vs. full shade, fall colors, showy flowers, native species, and wildlife friendly species. For the Nucleus, we designed a website with a homepage, a donation page, a visit us and about us section, and a page for stories of people directly affected by gun violence with an opportunity for anyone to share their story or reflection on the garden.',

    summary:
      'In 2019-20, we worked with HAVEN Free Clinic to design a potential intra-departmental navigation system in physical and digital form, such that volunteers every Saturday would have an easier time locating directors and finding their way around.',
    description:
      'Through the interview and immerse process, we found that there was inefficiency in the way departments talked to each other. Often, people turn to the Executive Director to ask where people are or who they should talk to, but we feel there might be another way to make these interactions more efficient. Some of the frictions include: lack of facial/name recognition among and within departments, especially volunteer to director, and people generally not knowing where other people/departments are located in the clinic. During the ideating phase, we brainstormed different methods that various other businesses/clinics use to better identify locations and staff members, including color-coded shirts, signage, and different organizational systems. Ultimately, we ended up prototyping a map overlaid with a face chart, both in physical form to hang and easily update each week with the directors present that day, as well as virtually in both web and mobile form for volunteers to easily access and check during clinic. We loved getting the chance to visit clinic several times, attend volunteer training, and volunteer town hall. It was incredible being able to see the inner workings of clinic, talking extensively with volunteers and directors, and seeing just how much of an impact this group of people had on the community.',

    summary:
      'In 2019-2020, we worked with Peels and Wheels Composting to develop a Community Composting: A Shared-Bin Ecosystem to increase the accessibility of Peels and Wheel’s composting services by making the cost and scale more flexible to suit the needs of a wider range of composters.',
    description:
      'Through the design process, many of our initial assumptions about Peels and Wheels composters were disrupted through interviews and survey findings. We found that most composters were happy and satisfied by the service that Peels and Wheels provides, but those living in apartments faced particular challenges, such as cleaning the bucket and finding a location to leave it outside. Further, we found that single-family homes are far more likely to compost compared to other living arrangements. Through many rounds of ideating, testing, and iterating, we developed a prototype for a model of compost pick up that would make the service more cost effective, and less labor-intensive for the composters and the Peels and Wheels team. Community Composting: A Shared Bin Ecosystem specifically targets those who live in apartments, multi-family homes, condominiums, and dormitories by allowing multiple units to share one compost bin. Therefore, those who do not produce enough organic waste to justify investing in the service alone, could not afford the service by themselves, or do not have the capacity to maintain a compost bin, are able to share a bin and the responsibilities that come with maintaining it. Peels and Wheels will in turn be able to collect more compost with fewer pick-up locations.',

Our first reiteration involved the simplification of the wording of the steps of using the bikeshare, inclusion of bike safety tips, bikeshare station map with biking times, new eye-catching header, and practicality-focused “fun facts” tailored to Yale undergraduates. We also made recommendations to Noa, such as adding a single ride payment plan, allowing users to make a Rider app account anywhere without a bike QR, and creating an immediate emergency helpline.',

    description:
      'During our interviews, we quickly realized that donors, especially large organizations, value time and efficiency. While food donation can be a complex process, we had to find a way to deliver key information to donors in a simple, and visually appealing way. Our final product, the Haven’s Harvest flyer, targeted large donors by highlighting the three simple “Action Steps” of food donation. Once the donor understands that food donation will not impede their everyday operations, they are much more likely to partner with Haven’s Harvest. The flyer also includes testimonials from both food donors and food recipients, showing the process from beginning to end. Our chapter of Design for America connected Haven’s Harvest with several Yale professional schools towards the end of the year. Beginning in the fall of 2019, Yale’s Slifka Center will be donating their food waste to Haven’s Harvest.',

    description:
      'When visiting the Yale Landscape Lab for the first time - a trip that neared 45-minutes - we initially sought to improve transportation to the YLL, or at least accessibility to its workshops and mission. But upon interviewing students and interns and volunteers, we realized that transportation difficulties made it difficult for members to meet and interact regularly, so we focused on building a stronger sense of community there. Our team completed several rounds of ideation, ultimately deciding to build at a three-sided bulletin board that would serve as a communication and interaction hub at the YLL. The panels are equipped with information about the YLL & its diverse missions, current members & running projects, and a blackboard for surveys & upcoming activities. With the panels complete and the structure upright, the team is excited to assemble the bulletin board for implementation on YLL’s campus in the fall.',
