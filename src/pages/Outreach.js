                <strong>Design thinking</strong> is a valuable tool with
                applications in education, business management, software
                engineering, graphic design, and more. Through our workshops,
                students learn to put these techniques into practice and
                cultivating skills in hands-on collaboration, problem solving,
                and outside-the-box thinking.

                We hold workshops for all ages, from Yale School of Management
                to local elementary school students, and from 20-minute
                hackathon sprints to week-long design intensives. We explain the
                principles of design thinking, practice creativity through
                warm-up exercises, and collaborate in groups to build solutions
                for real problems. Within our team, we hold tutorials on
                human-centered design specifics, including user interviews,
                ideation, and prototyping.
